Repository for Team A Project 2

Snowman Racers is a 2D multiplayer platformer set in a Winter Wonderland.
You play as a snowman! Racing, to get to the finish line before your snowman brothers. 
Watch out for those bottomless pits and lava pools along the way! They're super dangerous!
You'll be wearing the green hat, while your brothers will wear the red.
Upon completion of the race a leaderboard will pop up with everyone's times, if you race through the entire gme it will show everyone's total times.
Run, jump, and climb your way to victory in this fun Platformer Royale!
